# Go Fuzzing

Test your function against generated input corpus.
Based on https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/fuzz

## Run

```sh
go test -fuzz=Fuzz reverse_test.go -fuzztime 10s # by default, fuzzing goes on until first error is detected
```

Output:

```text

    Failing input written to testdata/fuzz/FuzzReverse/ddf3b8ab3d7347d1
    To re-run:
    go test -run=FuzzReverse/ddf3b8ab3d7347d1
=== NAME
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL    command-line-arguments  0.075s
```

Input that caused failure is stored under [file](./testdata/fuzz/FuzzReverse/ddf3b8ab3d7347d1):

```
go test fuzz v1
string("รฐ")
```
, meaning that input "รฐ" caused the test to fail.
