In the following package structure:

internalpackage
	frontend/
	backend/
		repository/
		internal/
			db/

"db" is under "internal".
"internal" means packages internal to "backend"
This means "db" can be imported from "repository" and from "backend" itself, but cannot from "frontend". 
And this makes sense.
